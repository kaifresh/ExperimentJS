UPDATING A SUBTREE

Considering that you already set your subtree in your app (git remote add subtree_name git@github.com:user/subtree_proj.git) your have to:

1- Subtree split

git subtree split -P lib -b new_branch_to_split where the lib is the path to your subtree project and the new_branch_to_split will only contain your lib code and will be pushed to your lib repo.

2- Subtree push

git push subtree_name new_branch_to_split:original_subtree_branch(i.e. master)

or

git push subtree_name new_branch_to_split:master

3- Always delete the temporary branch

git branch -D new_branch_to_split

4- Pull the changes in your other project that's using the subtree project

git subtree pull -P lib subtree_name original_subtree_branch(i.e. master)
